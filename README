# Installation guide:
- Install SUMO through https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.php
- Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (We used Python 3.12.6)
- Alternatively install the main packages individually(This should be enough):
- pip install sumo-rl
- pip install stable-baselines3

# You can run the models through the individual files:
# Follow comments for instructions on running to avoid overwriting current results
- `baselines.py`: Run and evaluate the sequential, random, and greedy baselines
- `dqn.py`: Train and evaluate the DQN model
- `genetic.py`: Train and evaluate the genetic algorithm
- `plot_eval.py`: Plot the results of the models with comparisons
- `display.py`: Display the results of the models with gui
